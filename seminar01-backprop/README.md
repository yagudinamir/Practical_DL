## Practice

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yandexdataschool/Practical_DL/blob/spring2019/week01_backprop/backprop.ipynb)

Open backprop.ipynb and follow instructions from there.

The practice itself doesn't count towards grade but it covers the core parts of homework 1.

__btw__ Homework1 has just been issued!
